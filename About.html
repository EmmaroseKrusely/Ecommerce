    <h1>Company Story</h1>
    <h3>Jane Doe is the CEO of the Only Ferns company, the reason she started the company is so <br>that people who love plants can get them sent to their door. She works with farms that grow <br>flowers and plants and through the Only Ferns website you buy the plants and the farms can<br> get extra profit. Only Ferns has been in business since September, 2020, and their goal <br>is to help farms acquire extra money. Jane Doe has had experience with working with people <br>who own farmland and grow plants on that land, and knows that it's hard to find people who <br>are willing to come out and buy the plants themselves, so she started this business. </h3>


    <h1>USP</h1>
    <h3>There are people out in the world who want to have plants around their house or growing on<br> their front lawns, but don't want to go out and buy the plants from gardeners who grow <br>the plants on their farms. That's why through the Only Ferns website, you order the plants<br> and they get sent to you from the gardeners on the farm without you needing to go <br>out and get them yourself. You sign up and get the plants sent straight to you.
